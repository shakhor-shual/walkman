# walkman
Walkman is an SMALL auxiliary tool for automating the management of deployment
and configuration of cloud infrastructure in small projects/tasks.
It was invented for situations where the solution to the problem looks 
much larger and more complex than the problem itself.
It is intended to improve  reuse of IaC code and the low coupling/high 
cohesion ratio in IaC projects.
